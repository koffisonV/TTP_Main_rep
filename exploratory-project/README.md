# Rick and Morty React App

This project revolves around the series of the TV show Rick and Morty. The goal of this project is not only to introduce
the show to the user, but to show the different characters, locations and episodes throughout this series.
We value the User Experience of the users, reason why we develop a clean, minimaliste and easy to use website. Enjoy!!


## Tools & Functionality

Of course this project was not only created using React, but we made use of powerfull components such as Tailwind CSS for the styling,
and the Rick & Morty API for the content you see on the website.

To test this project, you can clone this repo, head to the terminal and run `npm install` to download the necessary configurations, and finally run `npm start`
in your terminal and watch the magic happen...
